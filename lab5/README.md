# Lab 5

I downloaded mosquitto and paho-mqtt beforehand.  Getting the client done was such a hassle, but it makes sense.

Essentially, the client did not have an argument in its parentheses.  The error message asked for a callback api version, which I found by a migration file.  I copied and pasted that version into every file that asked for mqtt.Client().
