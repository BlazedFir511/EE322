> I am a 3/4 Electrical Engineer with a concentration in Robotics and Control.  My goal this semester is to do an individual project.  I need something to expand my knowledge in this field, especially since we have not had a lab in three semesters.  This can be a software-based project, but programming hardware can also be an option.

Went to Virginia over the summer, so I have a picture from that.  Probably the most _interesting_ thing in Virginia, funny enough.

Got my first Java code here:
`class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!"); 
    }
}`
