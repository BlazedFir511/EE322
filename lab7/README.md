# Lab 7

I made the thingspeak project earlier, I was just confused on what to do with the key, and I think I have the proper values.

I then installed some libraries.

Took the longest to get used to making the API keys. Took me forever to find where it is, but found it in the end.

Then, I got the cpu_spreadsheet file running after inserting the key into the nano file.

I got the google sheets running in class, and decided to put some more values after class.
